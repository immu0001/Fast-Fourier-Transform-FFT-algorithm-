FFT algorithm implimentation

An FFT, or Fast Fourier Transform, is an efficient implementation of a Discrete Fourier Transform. The algorithm transforms a sum of sinusoidal signals into into its pure frequency components. In the following quiz, we will demonstrate adding sinusoidal waves together and then deconstructing them back into their component frequencies.
